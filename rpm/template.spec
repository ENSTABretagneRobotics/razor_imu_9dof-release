%description
razor_imu_9dof is a package that provides a ROS driver for the Sparkfun Razor
IMU 9DOF. It also provides Arduino firmware that runs on the Razor board, and
which must be installed on the Razor board for the system to work. A node which
displays the attitude (roll, pitch and yaw) of the Razor board (or any IMU) is
provided for testing.
